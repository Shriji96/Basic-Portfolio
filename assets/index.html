        My name is Shriji Shah. I moved to United States from India as a 9 year old kid aspiring to live the American Dream. My parents decided to move to this country in hope of a better life for my sisters and i. This led to me being self-motivated to give back to them for all the struggles they have endured to make me the person who i am right now.

        The technology boom that occured during my upbringing made me really interested in what actually goes behind the computer that is easily doing all the work for me. This is one of the reasons i am studying to be a web developer right now. Ultimately, i want to become a software engineer to understand more in depth the power behind the technology that is driving the world to become the power it has progressed to become.
